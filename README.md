# CalculusII
Theses are my calculus II slides from summer of 2017, University of New Hampshire, based on University Calculus, Early Transcendentals, Third edition, Hass, Weir, Thomas.
A few graphs and pictures are taken from the text book.
My students and I completed the solutions and I wrote the answers with my Microsoft Surface pen, 
but don't seem to be able find the final PDFs. Let me know if you are interested in the latex files.
